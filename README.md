# Cybersecurity Internship – Task 2: Operating System Security Fundamentals (Linux & Windows)

## Objective
To understand and practice OS-level security fundamentals by exploring user accounts, permissions, access control, firewall configuration, running processes/services, and basic OS hardening practices in Linux and Windows.

## Tools Used
- Ubuntu Linux (VM)
- Windows Security / Windows Defender
- UFW (Linux Firewall) / Windows Firewall

## Topics Covered
- User accounts and access control mechanisms
- Administrator vs Standard user privileges
- Linux file permissions and ownership:
  - `ls -l`
  - `chmod`
  - `chown`
- Firewall enabling and verification:
  - UFW in Linux
  - Windows Firewall in Windows
- Running processes and services identification
- Disabling unnecessary services to reduce attack surface
- OS hardening best practices checklist

## Deliverables
- ✅ OS Security Checklist Document (Task Summary + Checklist + Interview Q&A):
  - `Cybersecurity_Task2_OS_Security_Checklist_ElevateLabs.docx`

## Final Outcome
After completing this task, I gained a clear understanding of OS-level security, basic hardening techniques, and how to reduce system attack surface by managing permissions, firewall rules, and services.

## Interview Questions Prepared
1) What is OS hardening?  
2) What are file permissions in Linux?  
3) Why should unnecessary services be disabled?  
4) Difference between root and normal user?  
5) What is the least privilege principle?
